WHAT IS IN THIS RESOURCE PACK:

	-(as far as I can determine) all of the barest essentials (folders, .patch files, and assets) to get a custom species integrated and walking around in the game. Technically speaking, you can plug this resource pack into your /mods folder to play a carbon copy of the vanilla Human species.
	-AI .patch files to ensure AI dialogue functions properly
	-This readme.

WHAT IS NOT IN THIS RESOURCE PACK:

	-Custom assets. As a template/starter kit, the 'myrace' custom species copies or refers exclusively to vanilla Human assets, and you'll need to replace these manually.
	-Tutorials. This resource pack is only intended to jumpstart species creation and save new modders the drudgery of patching two dozen plus files just to get their species and AI working in the game.
	-Anything concerning items or objects whatsoever.

HOW TO USE THIS RESOURCE PACK:

	-Extract this .zip (myrace.rar) file into your \Starbound\mods folder (Or wherever you please, but mods will only function in \mods)
	-Replace ALL instances of "myrace" with the name of your new species
	-THIS INCLUDES ALL FILES AND FOLDERS. If you do not properly rename all assets, the game will crash or otherwise work incorrectly
	-Begin replacing vanilla assets with your species' custom assets or assets you have permission from another modder to use, referring to the file structure of the vanilla species for files and folders not included in this resource pack
	-???
	-Profit!

USEFUL TOOLS:

While there are possibly better alternatives, Paint.NET and Notepad++ are the tools I've been using to contruct this resource pack and my own mods; they're vastly superior options to the default Windows software (MS Paint and Notepad) for editing sprite and text assets, respectively, and are free to download and use. Get them here:

To test your .patch files, go here:

http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com/jsonpatch.jsp

Copy the contents of your .patch file into the top field and the contents of the file you want to patch into the bottom field, then press "Apply patch". If the field on the right says "Patch result: success", you're good to go.
